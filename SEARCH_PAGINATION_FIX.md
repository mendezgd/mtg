# Card Search Pagination Fix

## Problem
The card search functionality was limited to showing only 100 results maximum, even when there were more cards matching the search criteria. This was due to:

1. **Hard limit**: `MAX_RESULTS = 100` in the `useCardSearch` hook
2. **Single page fetch**: Only fetching page 1 of results
3. **No pagination handling**: Not implementing proper multi-page fetching

## Solution
Implemented comprehensive pagination to fetch ALL available results:

### Changes Made

#### 1. Updated `useCardSearch` Hook (`src/hooks/use-card-search.ts`)

**Before:**
- Limited to 100 results per search
- Only fetched page 1
- No pagination logic

**After:**
- Increased to 175 cards per page (Scryfall's maximum)
- Fetches ALL pages automatically
- Shows total count and page information

**Key Improvements:**
```typescript
// Before
const MAX_RESULTS = 100; // Limited to 100 cards

// After  
const CARDS_PER_PAGE = 175; // Scryfall's maximum per page
```

**New Pagination Logic:**
1. **Initial Request**: Get total count and first page
2. **Calculate Pages**: Determine how many pages needed
3. **Fetch All Pages**: Sequentially fetch remaining pages
4. **Rate Limiting**: Add delays to be respectful to Scryfall API
5. **Error Handling**: Continue if individual pages fail

#### 2. Updated CardSearch Component (`src/components/CardSearch.tsx`)

**Enhanced Results Display:**
- Shows total cards found
- Indicates when multiple pages were fetched
- Displays "Mostrando todos los resultados" message
- Enhanced loading state with page count information

### Features

#### ✅ Complete Results
- Now shows ALL cards matching search criteria
- No more 100-card limit
- Handles searches with thousands of results

#### ✅ Performance Optimized
- Respects Scryfall API rate limits
- Adds delays between requests (50ms between pages, 100ms every 10 card details)
- Continues fetching even if individual pages fail

#### ✅ Better User Experience
- Clear indication of total results
- Shows when multiple pages are being fetched
- Maintains responsive UI during long searches

#### ✅ Error Resilience
- Handles API failures gracefully
- Continues with partial results if some pages fail
- Clear error messages for different failure types

### Example Usage

**Search for "merfolk":**
- Before: Limited to 100 merfolk cards
- After: Shows ALL merfolk cards (potentially 500+ results)

**Search with filters:**
- Before: Limited results even with specific filters
- After: Complete filtered results

### Technical Details

#### API Respect
- Uses Scryfall's maximum of 175 cards per page
- Implements proper delays to avoid rate limiting
- Handles API errors gracefully

#### Memory Management
- Fetches pages sequentially to avoid overwhelming the browser
- Processes card details in batches
- Maintains performance with large result sets

#### User Feedback
- Shows loading progress for multi-page searches
- Displays total count and page information
- Clear indication when all results are loaded

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. **Search for broad terms** like "merfolk", "dragon", "forest"
2. **Use filters** to generate large result sets
3. **Verify complete results** are displayed
4. **Check loading states** during multi-page fetches

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements:
- Virtual scrolling for very large result sets
- Caching of search results
- Progressive loading (show first page while fetching others)
- Search result sorting options
